### Hi there üëã

I am the Chief Scientisat at [Distributional](https://distributional.com), where we're building an automated testing platform for deep statistical testing.  I am also the founder of [DataScientific, Inc.](https://datascientific.com), an AI Advisory and Consulting firm specializing in the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI solutions. Previously, I was the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai), a leading AI company known for producing [H2O](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3), an open source, distributed machine learning platform, along with Driverless AI, h2oGPT, LLMStudio, and a range of other Enterprise AI systems.  My tenure at H2O.ai was marked by the creation and leadership of the development team for the [H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) algorithm (the first open source enterprise AutoML platform), where I also spearheaded efforts in explainable/interpretable AI, algorithmic fairness and AI benchmarking and measurement.  

Additionally, I am the founder of [WiMLDS (Women in Machine Learning and Data Science)](https://github.com/wimlds) and a co-founder of [R-Ladies Global](https://github.com/rladies), both organizations aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the AI field.  I also collaborate with the [OpenML](https://github.com/openml) organization to develop open source benchmarking tools for machine learning.
