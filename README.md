### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai), the company that produces the open source, distributed machine learning platform, [H2O](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3).  At H2O.ai, I lead the development of the [H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) algorithm.
